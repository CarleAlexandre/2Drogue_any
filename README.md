#THE GAME

___

## how it started

I give myself 2 mounth to finish this project, the roadmap can be seen in roguelike_projecct_roadmap.md

the point is to challenge myself to finish a simple commercial game

```c
typedef struct {
	int height, width;
	float rotation;
}	obstacle_hitbox;
```
___

## idea

- base building and defense (kinda more like terraria)
- dungeon exploration
- wave survival
- exploration ?
- hand crafted world no procedural (only dungeon using presets parts)
= using advanced shader using normal texture and depth of object(but still in top down 2D)
